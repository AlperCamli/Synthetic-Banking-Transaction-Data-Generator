## Project Overview
This project is a sophisticated synthetic data generator designed to simulate realistic banking transaction environments. It was developed as part of an internship project at **VakıfBank Business Intelligence & Reporting Department** to overcome strict privacy regulations that prohibit the use of production customer data for development and testing.

The generator produces a coherent, relational dataset (OLTP) capable of feeding an end-to-end Business Intelligence workflow—from data generation and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) to Data Warehousing and DataMart creation.

## Key Features
* **Privacy Compliance:** Generates fully synthetic data that mirrors real-world consumer behavior without exposing sensitive information.
* **Relational Integrity:** Produces **10 interrelated tables** with consistent surrogate keys, ensuring valid joins across Customers, Accounts, Transactions, and Merchants.
* **Behavioral Segmentation:** Simulates distinct customer personas (e.g., *Blue Collar, Young Professionals, Students*) with unique income cycles, spending habits, and risk profiles.
* **Temporal Realism:** Incorporates salary days, rent cycles, bill due dates, seasonal spending spikes, and weekend/holiday effects.
* **Advanced Logic:** Includes "Discipline Factors" for budgeting simulation and a "Cash Shadow" mechanism to mimic untraceable cash usage after ATM withdrawals.
* **Reproducibility:** Uses seeded randomization to ensure the same dataset can be regenerated consistently for testing pipelines.

## Dataset Structure
The generator creates a normalized schema consisting of the following 10 tables:

| Table Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Customers** | Demographics, credit scores, income levels, and behavioral segments. |
| **Accounts** | Account balances, overdraft limits, and account types. |
| **Transactions** | The core fact table containing amounts, timestamps, and balance updates. |
| **Merchants** | Merchant IDs, names, and location data. |
| **Categories** | Transaction categories (e.g., Grocery, Rent, Bills) and essential/non-essential flags. |
| **Channels** | Transaction channels (ATM, POS, Mobile, Branch). |
| **Calendar** | Date dimension with holiday flags, fiscal quarters, and weekend indicators. |
| **Branches** | Bank branch locations and identifiers. |
| **Cities** | Geographic data for branches and merchants. |
| **Transaction Types** | Definitions for transfers, payments, and deposits. |

## Generation Logic & Mathematics
The core of this project lies in its ability to simulate human behavior mathematically rather than just randomization.

## Project Features

### Customer Modeling
- Demographics (age, gender, education, employment)
- Segmentation (students, young professionals, families, retirees, high-income)
- Income composition:
  - Salary
  - Passive income
  - Rental income
- Credit score & dependents
- Behavioral weights:
  - Category preferences
  - Channel preferences
  - Time-of-day activity
  - Weekly transaction intensity

### Transaction Generation
- One full year of transactions per customer
- Deterministic recurring events:
  - Salary payments (fixed monthly day)
  - Bills & utilities (fixed due dates)
  - Rent payments (in/out)
- Probabilistic daily spending:
  - Grocery, gas, restaurant, shopping, healthcare, entertainment, etc.
- Channel modeling:
  - POS, Online, ATM, Branch
- Balance tracking:
  - Previous balance
  - Balance after transaction
- Currency: **USD**

### 1. Customer Generation
Customers are generated using **segment-specific distributions**:

- Income scaling
- Employment patterns
- Education levels
- Channel & category weights
- Transaction frequency

### 2. Transaction Logic

Each transaction follows:

- **Date**  
  - Uniform weekly distribution  
  - Normal distribution by hour (`μ ≈ evening`, `σ` per segment)

- **Category**
  - Weighted by customer preferences

- **Channel**
  - Weighted by digital vs physical behavior

- **Amount**
  - Category-specific ranges
  - Scaled by income level

- **Balance Update**
  - Credits increase balance
  - Debits decrease balance


  ### 2.1 The "Discipline" Factor
  A "daily discretionary cap" is calculated for each customer based on their income vs. fixed outflows (rent/bills). A sigmoidal function is applied to simulate "budget discipline," determining if a customer saves money or overspends into their overdraft.

  ### 2.2 The "Cash Shadow"
  To solve the issue of ATM withdrawals simply being "money exiting the system," this project implements a **Cash Shadow**. When a customer withdraws cash, a "shadow balance" is created. This temporarily suppresses visible card spending (POS transactions) until the cash is "spent" virtually, mimicking real-world cash substitution.



## End-to-End Workflow Context
While this repository focuses on the **Data Generation** phase, it was designed as the first step in a larger pipeline:
1.  **Generation:** Python scripts produce CSVs/DataFrames.
2.  **OLTP Storage:** Data is loaded into **PostgreSQL** (Normalized Schema).
3.  **ETL:** **Apache Spark** extracts and transforms data (SCD Type 1 & 3).
4.  **OLAP Storage:** Data is loaded into **ClickHouse** (Star Schema).
5.  **Analytics:** DataMarts are built for reporting.
